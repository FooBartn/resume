* I started, and volunteer teaching, a local elementary school computer science club. I utilize <a href="http://code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a> 
courses and <a href="http://www.robotturtles.com/" target="_blank">Robot Turtles</a> to introduce 1st-3rd graders to programming concepts and 
challenge them to think differently.
* I volunteer at the local school as a part of the <a href="http://www.fathers.com/watchdogs/">Watch D.O.G.S.</a>, a one-of-a-kind, school-based father 
involvement program that works to support education and safety.
